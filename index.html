            <h3>Written Questions</h3>
            <p>1. On my dashboard, Graph 1 shows the top 10 video games of all time by their Global Sale
            Value. Graph 2 is a world map with 3 regions: NA, EU and JP. In each region, there is a 
            hovering tooltip that indicates the region, most popular genre in that region and the aggregated
            sales figure of that genre in the region. Graph 3 is an interactive bar graph that shows not 
            only the top publisher in a given genre, but the top 3 publishers in a given genre. Click on
            a button to change which genre to view.</p>
            <p>2. D3 was helpful with the scope of availablity of data visualization. With some research,
                it was intuitive to create different dynamic bargraphs integrated with html buttons as well
                as map and tooltip overlays without using a built-in html tooltip. D3 was also useful with dynamic
                timing of durations, color specturms and easy integration with html. D3 also helped with
                the global map portion of the assignment with many different avaiable tools to choose from. 
                The overall integration of all of this with html was the main reason D3 was very useful in 
                creating data visualizations
            </p>
            <p>3. D3 in my expereince was a challenge primarily because of javascript and integration
                into html. Towards the end of the assignment, as I became more accustomed to javascript
                and html, it became clear that D3 was not a bad tool at all. However, usage of html to
                display data visualizations directly may not have been the most fluid way to manage and process
                data and display it especially when many other libraries in python exist and would make the 
                transition between these workflows more fluid. For example, in the case of processing data with
                pandas before using D3, there may have been a more seamless way to create visualizations. D3
                would also not be the best tool for creating visualizations because of the relatively small documentation
                and user envrironment available online. Compared to other tools, it was very difficult to find
                many relavent sources of documentation, especially for v5, making it difficult to determine differences 
                between this and other versions like v4. These issues I listed would only be exasperated the more
                complex the visualization task is, making other alternatives more appealing.
            </p>
            <p>4. My dashboard is relatively accesible to those that are colorblind with the high contrast
                of my data visualizations with the background white color. To support assistive technology, 
                my tooling structure is not complex and takes advantage of large bold buttons and hovering tooltips.
                My data visualization would be least accesible towards those with blindness that rely on a screen-reader
                and sound to access the data. Those with color blindness or low-blindness may find my data visualizations 
                accesible because of the contrasting colors and relative large buttons used to manipulate the data.
                In response to the suggestion on "A Comprehensive Guide to Accesible Data Visualization", they suggest
                to aviod tooltips which I have implemented. This may be a good idea to assist those that are visually 
                impaired and make the nature of the data more intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>5. Throughout my design process, I immediately took note to the map portion of the assignment which
                provided extra credit. I also noticed that a tool-tip was required so I decided to combine these two 
                on graph 2. Now, I understand that graph 2 may not be necessarily the most accesible and I may have been 
                able to remedy this by using a legend instead. I also could have made the font-size larger as a form of
                accesibility that would have been quick to implement. Time - restraints are the main factors that kept
                me from acheiving these goals, however, I believe that my dynamic and static bar graphs as well as my map 
                are pretty accesible given the constrains I was given in this assignment such as including a tooltip.
